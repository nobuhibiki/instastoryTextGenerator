I am trying something new.

This is an automatically generated image that is made from python that takes text I put into it and then it puts it on top of an image that is taken from unsplash automatically by using Python.

It's mostly just a generation tool so that I don't have to open photoshop, illustrator, or use the instagram in built instastory tool in order to put my thoughts into instastories because at the moment the plans are to start writing more and getting my writing more in people's faces, and what better way to do that than through the medium of instagram stories :)

Tool was made in a night using Python3 + Pillow, two cups of coffee, some pilus, and a whole lot of googling. First foray into "code generated images", and boy oh boy am I up for some fun ride if I do end up learning more about how to create images from codes. Procedural images are not very easy it seems.

This thing is super simple and very bodgy, but it should get the job done. All I need to do is to input some text into a txt file, run a "python .\image_edit.py" and add the parameter for whatever I'm looking for, and it should automatically cut the text to wrap, see how many images it's gonna take to print out all the text, look up the images using the search term I asked it, get those images, crop, blur, darken, and then draw the text on top of the image.

Fun one night project. Might explore more to see if I can add automatic bolds and italics but I'm not holding my breathe for that one.

May this bring more writings.
